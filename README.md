# Portfolio

> Description the project.
Your portfolio is one of the most powerful tools in your software developer toolbox; it‚Äôs the easiest way of showing what you‚Äôre truly capable of as a developer, and is a quick and simple way for recruiters and hiring managers to get an idea of what you can bring to their teams.

As you work your way through Microverse curriculum materials you will complete several small projects that will combine to create a website for your portfolio. A portfolio website is a key job searching tool for a web developer, and we want you to start working on it from the beginning of the Microverse program. In this project, you will precisely replicate one of the portfolio templates we are providing for you. However, later on during your Microverse journey you will include your own projects in the portfolio in order to use it for job searching.
